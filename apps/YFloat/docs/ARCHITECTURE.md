# YFloat Architecture

YFloat follows a **single-owner rule**: different interaction surfaces may have different UI and lifetimes, but the same low-level behavior must have one implementation and one policy owner.

The normal rule for future changes is simple:

> **Extend the owner; do not clone the implementation.**

Root and LSPosed are optional providers. They may enhance a backend, but they must not create another gesture, capture, OCR, selection, result, settings, or workflow pipeline.

## 2. Floating input and gesture ownership

### `FloatIconView`
Owns one touch stream only:

- tap / double tap;
- configured long press;
- directional gesture;
- temporary-follow drag;
- Direct selection dwell;
- explicit icon-position move.

It must not grow Accessibility traversal, screenshot backend selection, OCR parsing, result UI, or Circle recognition logic.

### `GestureClassifier` / `GestureActionMapper`
Own gesture classification and gesture/preference -> `ActionId` mapping.

### `ActionRegistry`
Owns the action catalog only: IDs exposed to settings, labels and default preference mappings.

### `ActionExecutor`
Single owner of executing an already-resolved `ActionId`. New executable behavior belongs here; feature code must not add its own action switch.

### `FloatingIconLayoutPolicy` / `FloatVisibilityController`
Layout/persistence and visibility reasons remain separate owners. `FloatService` applies their decisions and must not reimplement their policies.

## 3. Screen geometry

### `ScreenGeometry`
Single owner of physical display bounds, usable system-bar-excluded bounds, density, dp conversion and integer clamping.

Feature code must not call `WindowManager.getCurrentWindowMetrics()` merely to rediscover screen width/height.

### `AppSystemBarInsets`
Owns Activity-content insets only. Android 15+ edge-to-edge Activity layout is a different boundary from screenshot/overlay geometry and must stay separate.

### `CoordinateMapper`
Generic Matrix-backed mapping between two rectangular coordinate spaces.

### `ScreenBitmapTransform`
Single frame-specific mapping owner between:

- frozen screenshot bitmap pixels;
- absolute SCREEN coordinates;
- overlay View coordinates;
- OCR document geometry.

Callers must not manually add status-bar offsets or multiply screen/bitmap ratios.

### `ScreenshotGeometry`
Owns screen-rectangle screenshot cropping and system-bar-aware screenshot cropping. It delegates coordinate conversion to `ScreenBitmapTransform`.

### `CropMath` / `SelectionCropper`
`CropMath` is intentionally narrow: pure View-space -> bitmap-space rectangle math used by `SelectionCropper` only. It must not regain screen/bitmap mapping; that belongs to `CoordinateMapper` / `ScreenBitmapTransform`.

`SelectionCropper` owns rectangle/freehand selection crop and masking plus independent result-bitmap ownership.

### `SelectionGeometry`
Single owner of text/View selection anchor geometry used by selection and menus. Do not reintroduce global menu-anchor state.

## 4. Accessibility semantics

### `AccessibilityNodeSemantics`
Single definition of what an Accessibility node means.

Rules:

- `AccessibilityNodeInfo.getText()` is visible View text;
- content description, hint and state description are semantic labels;
- semantic labels must not silently become visually rendered text.

### `AccessibilityCandidateCollector`
Single ordinary Accessibility tree walker. It produces Accessibility-only `ScreenCandidate` objects for Direct selection and explicit region View-text extraction.

There is no second point-traversal or screenshot-derived visual-candidate collector. Direct snapshots the tree once at touch start; MOVE is cached geometry only.

### `ScreenSelectionModel`
Single cached Accessibility candidate ranking/hit-test owner. It has no parallel visual-candidate bucket.

## 5. Direct selection

### `ViewSelectionEngine`
Owns same-touch Direct selection after the dwell gate.

Routing:

- visible TEXT -> View text result;
- VIEW/image -> View image result;
- dragged Direct region -> screenshot;
- ROOT/fallback -> screenshot only where explicitly intended.

### `ViewHoverOverlay`
Passive cached-candidate highlight layer only.

There is no independent full-screen `ViewSelectionOverlay`. Normal configurable OCR goes through the shared screenshot OCR-region selector. Explicit View text remains available only where the user deliberately chooses the region editor's View-text action.

Native Accessibility text in Direct is a View-text result, not OCR.

## 6. Overlay hosting

### `FlOverlayWindowHost`
Single owner of ordinary overlay add/update/remove/migration behavior.

Feature controllers must not copy WindowManager hosting code. AccessibilityService may directly host accessibility overlays because it is one implementation used by this shared host.

## 7. Screenshot lifecycle

### `ScreenCaptureBackend`
Backend selector only. Accessibility is the normal backend; Root/LSPosed alternatives are used only through explicit gates.

### `ScreenshotCaptureSession`
Single normal capture lifecycle:

```text
acquire hide lease(s)
  -> settle
  -> ScreenCaptureBackend
  -> restore lease(s)
```

### `ScreenshotHideCoordinator`
Reference-counted icon hiding. Never replace this with one boolean because overlapping capture flows must not reveal YFloat early.

### `CaptureSystemBarsPolicy`
Single status/navigation capture policy shared by screenshot and Circle.

### `ScreenshotController`
Business routing only:

- full screenshot save;
- region selector;
- editable-region capture;
- View capture;
- OCR capture;
- bounds crop delivery.

Screenshot region mode and OCR region mode share the same internal selector flow and differ only by mode.

## 8. OCR

### `MlKitTextCore`
Single ML Kit parser/foundation:

- recognizer creation/selection;
- Text block/line/element/symbol -> `OcrDocument`;
- shared fallback character splitting.

No feature may add another ML Kit -> `OcrDocument` parser.

### `PaddleOcrBridge`
Single PP-OCR adapter. It performs recognition and converts engine-native output to `OcrDocument`, then immediately normalizes through `OcrCanonicalGeometry`.

There is no separate detector-only application pipeline.

### `OcrCanonicalGeometry`
Single engine-neutral normalization contract. PP output is normalized to the same stable line/element/symbol ordering semantics used by the ML path without invoking ML Kit again.

### `OcrEngine`
Normal OCR strategy and lifecycle owner:

- PP Small/Medium policy/escalation;
- ML Kit script fusion;
- quality selection;
- UI/document generations;
- UI recognition lifecycle notifications;
- final dispatch.

It reads OCR configuration only through `FloatSettings`. The removed enhanced/mono preprocessing and separate quality-policy passes must not be reintroduced as parallel pipelines.

Region UI must submit a bitmap to `OcrEngine`; it must not separately maintain OCR-start/success/failure state.

## 9. Circle: one OCR-only pipeline

Current Circle is the **YFloat-native Circle implementation**. Its private source namespace is `FLCircle*`; it is not Google Circle to Search. A future Google CTS integration must live in a separate Google CTS namespace and must not reuse or overload the `FLCircle*` classes.

Normal Circle is deliberately **OCR-only**. It does not traverse Accessibility Views for text, merge View text into OCR, mask View bounds, or run a parallel TextMap detector pipeline.

The only normal Circle chain is:

```text
FLCircleController
  -> FLCircleCapture
  -> FLCircleInlineOverlay
  -> FLCircleTextResolver
  -> CircleStableOcr
  -> CircleSelectionPlanner
  -> CircleGestureTextSelector
  -> CircleTextSelectionModel
```

### `FLCircleController`
Owns Circle generation, frozen-workspace launch, screenshot-hide lease, border/shade lifecycle and close cleanup.

### `FLCircleCapture`
Owns the frozen `Frame`: bitmap + exact screen bounds + one `ScreenBitmapTransform`.

### `FLCircleInlineOverlay`
Owns Circle UI/input only: tap, stroke/scribble, editable screenshot rectangle, selection handles, confirmation and close UI.

Initial text selection is applied only from the planner-provided `initialSelectionDocument`. The UI does not perform a second tap hit-test, nearby snap or gesture-bounds intersection fallback. Handle dragging after initialization remains UI editing.

### `FLCircleTextResolver`
Owns one cached full-screen OCR document per frozen frame and optional per-gesture correction scheduling.

Full-screen OCR is single-flight/latest-pending and cached. Optional PP correction receives a planner-owned ROI; it cannot reinterpret the user's selection range or synthesize a fallback ROI.

### `CircleStableOcr`
Circle OCR-engine adapter only. Full-frame engine and correction engine are independently selectable. It returns `OcrDocument`; it does not own gesture semantics.

### `CircleSelectionPlanner`
Sole owner of Circle initial text selection semantics and correction ROI.

### `CircleGestureTextSelector`
Owns low-level OCR geometry hit/range mechanics used by the planner.

### `CircleTextSelectionModel`
Owns retained full-document selection state and post-initialization handle editing. It maps planner hints into the context document; it does not invent another initial selection.

Removed experimental/legacy paths must not be reintroduced:

- `CircleViewTextSnapshot`;
- `ViewTextOcrMask`;
- `ViewTextGeometryRefiner`;
- `CircleTextMap`;
- detector-only `PaddleTextDetectorBridge`;
- `CircleSelectOverlay` compatibility shim.

## 10. Recognition workflow state

### `RecognitionWorkflowState`
Single screenshot/OCR/recognition lifecycle state owner:

```text
IDLE -> CAPTURING -> RECOGNIZING -> RESULTS -> IDLE
```

`FloatService` talks to this class directly. The old `CircleStateMachine` compatibility facade has been removed.

A new generation begins only from IDLE; phase transitions inside the same workflow keep the generation.

## 11. Results

Every official screenshot, View and OCR result converges here:

```text
ResultSession
  -> ResultController
  -> singleTop ResultActivity
  -> UnifiedResultDialogFragment
  -> UnifiedResultPanel / TextSelectionSurface
```

### `ResultSession`
Single business state / bitmap-ownership object for screenshot, View text, View image and OCR.

### `ResultController`
Single pending-token and Activity-launch boundary.

### `ResultSurfaceRouter`
Thin construction facade only. It creates the proper session and delegates to `ResultController`; it must not host another result UI.

### `UnifiedResultDialogFragment` / `UnifiedResultPanel`
Single visible result system. Close, outside tap, dismiss and destruction converge on one teardown path.

### `OcrResultDispatcher`
Single OCR output boundary: active inline sink when appropriate, otherwise the normal result system.

## 12. Floating action menus

### `FloatingMenuUi`
Single visual owner for text and image floating menus: surface, text, ripple, rows and icon sizing.

### `FloatingMenuPositioner`
Single menu placement/clamp owner: around-anchor placement, fallback position and locked submenu row.

### `TextActionMenuController`
Single text-menu entry point from selection surfaces. It receives immutable `SelectionSnapshot` state.

### `FloatActionMenu` / `ImageActionMenu`
Own action-specific content only. They must not duplicate palette, ripple, screen-inset or placement algorithms.

Global menu-anchor state has been removed; anchors are passed explicitly.

## 13. Region selection

### `RegionOverlay`
Simple rectangle/freehand region interaction only.

### `EditableRegionOverlay`
Editable rectangle interaction and AUTO/View/OCR choice only.

### `RegionContentResolver`
Single explicit-region View-text hit/filter/sort/dedupe owner.

This View-text resolver is intentionally separate from Circle. Explicit region View extraction may use Accessibility; normal OCR and normal Circle may not.

## 14. Settings

### `FloatSettings`
Single normal preference read/write boundary. UI and OCR code use typed getters/setters and compound operations rather than direct `SharedPreferences.Editor` or raw preference reads.

The backing `SharedPreferences` is not exposed. Migration and atomic compound writes live inside `FloatSettings`; infrastructure that must observe the preference file may bind to it only at its own infrastructure boundary.

Compound state such as custom-icon URI + style, slideshow URI list + style, Root authorization status, and Circle cancel-button coordinates is written atomically inside `FloatSettings`.

### `SettingsPageUi`
Single reusable settings-control builder for switches, sliders, spinners, OCR models and language selection.

Feature pages declare settings; they do not reimplement storage listeners or common control construction.

## 15. System panel / notification shade

### `FlSystemPanelController`
Single owner of notification-shade detection, dismissal, fallback and overlay-ready timing.

`ResultReadyCoordinator` only determines when a captured ResultActivity is visibly ready.

## 16. Privileged providers

Ordinary mode remains complete with Accessibility + normal overlay permission.

Optional Root/LSPosed providers may enhance a backend only when explicitly enabled.

They may not:

1. redefine View/text semantics;
2. create another result pipeline;
3. fork gesture/Direct/Circle state machines;
4. fork settings storage;
5. create a parallel capture policy.

Disabling privileged providers must return to the same ordinary pipeline.

The abandoned LSPosed View-content metadata/policy/preference-bridge experiment is removed; LSPosed currently provides the controlled runtime/status channel and secure-screenshot enhancement only.

## 17. Regression gates

`.github/workflows/debug.yml` must remain the structural-change gate:

1. `testDebugUnitTest`;
2. `lintDebug`;
3. `assembleDebug`;
4. upload debug APK.

Device validation after a large refactor should cover:

- tap/double tap/long press and directional gestures;
- temporary icon follow and explicit position move;
- Direct text/View/image and dragged region;
- full/region screenshot and system-bar options;
- editable-region AUTO/View/OCR;
- normal OCR region selection and result actions;
- notification-shade capture;
- Circle open/close, planner-owned tap/range text selection, correction, screenshot rectangle and handles;
- rapid repeated starts to verify stale async work is cancelled.

## 18. Future-change rule

Before adding a helper, controller, state class, geometry function, menu style, settings writer or OCR wrapper, first check whether an owner above already exists.

If two features need the same low-level behavior, extract or extend the shared owner and leave feature classes responsible only for their true UI/scheduling differences.
