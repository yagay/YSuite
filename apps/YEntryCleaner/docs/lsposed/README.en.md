# YEntryCleaner

[简体中文](https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/com.yagay.YEntryCleaner/blob/main/README.md) | **English**

<!-- section:intro -->
Trim Android share, open-with, browser, and text-processing menus so frequently used apps appear first. With Root access, YEntryCleaner can also manage app-provided Quick Settings tiles, shortcut creation entries, and home-screen widgets.

<!-- section:requirements -->
## Requirements

- Android 12 or newer.
- **Rule filtering and ordering** require a framework supporting **modern libxposed API 102**. Enable the module, configure the recommended scope, and restart as required by the framework.
- **Component management** additionally requires Root permission through KernelSU, Magisk, or another Root manager. Enabling the LSPosed module does not grant Root access.

<!-- section:features -->
## Features

- **Rule filtering**: Configure Share, Multiple Share, Open With, Browser, and Text Processing separately. Supports app search and per-app component expansion. Choose Hide selected, Show only selected, or Show all; when a category has no selected rules, everything is shown.
- **Bulk-operation locks and app-type filtering**: Rules, Ordering, and Components share the same lock behavior. Fully or partially locked entries skip Select All/Invert-style operations but remain manually editable. A compact dropdown filters All, User apps, or System apps. Neither app type nor lock state participates in ordering or changes selected/partial/unselected state.
- **Priority ordering**: Save a separate app order for each category. Selecting an app adds it to the priority list, while deselecting returns it to the default name order. Supports long-press drag-and-drop as well as move up/down controls. Locks never rewrite the saved order.
- **Component management**: Standard tiles use TileService discovery; shortcut creation entries merge Android LauncherApps configuration activities with legacy ACTION_CREATE_SHORTCUT; widgets prefer the AppWidgetManager provider registry with manifest scanning as a fallback. Discovery is public-API first with compatibility fallbacks and fail-open error handling. After an APK update, a runtime capability handshake keeps old system_server hooks on the safe fallback path until the newer discovery protocol is confirmed. Root performs the real disable; YEntryCleaner also persists the disabled policy, filters discovery through LSPosed/system_server, and automatically reconciles restored component state after boot, unlock, and app updates.
- **Backup and diagnostics**: Import and export JSON backups for rules and ordering, view module status, and export diagnostic logs, including persistent component policy, discovery filtering, and boot-reconcile results.

<!-- section:usage -->
## Usage Notes

Selections on the Rules page apply only to the components shown for the current category and search conditions; they do not disable the entire app. The Components page changes the actual enabled state of Android components, so the two features serve different purposes. Bulk locks use **swipe right to lock and swipe left to unlock**; unlocked rows show no lock icon and locked rows show a status icon. Full locks protect an entire app while partial locks protect only selected child entries. Locks only skip Select All/Invert-style bulk actions, remain manually editable, do not participate in ordering, and do not change selected/partial/unselected state. Category locks remain independently stored, while Locked under All aggregates them. Rules, Ordering, and Components also provide a compact Apps: All / User apps / System apps dropdown that limits the current view and bulk-action target set without changing saved order or rule state.

Component operations affect only the Android user where YEntryCleaner is installed. Real Root disable remains authoritative; the persistent disabled policy is also used by LSPosed discovery filtering and automatic boot reconciliation. Delayed checks run after startup/unlock, a second settled-startup pass follows, and app install/update events trigger another check. Package add/update/removal invalidates discovery caches automatically. Diagnostics record component discovery sources (PackageManager / AppWidgetManager / LauncherApps) and the runtime component-discovery protocol to help diagnose missing entries or stale-hook compatibility. Disabling a component can affect tiles or widgets that are already added, and re-enabling it does not guarantee that its previous position will be restored. Uninstalling the module or clearing app data does not revert disabled component states, and rule backups do not include those states.

Vendor-customized choosers, apps that reorder candidates themselves, or custom in-app menus may not be supported. Shortcut management does not cover every dynamic, pinned, or private shortcut, and built-in system tiles without a standalone service are outside the managed scope.

<!-- section:release -->
Official builds in the author repository and the LSPosed repository use the same APK and pinned release signature. Debug builds may use a different signature, so export your rules and review component states before uninstalling.

<!-- section:feedback -->
When reporting an issue, include the Android version, device model, framework version, and reproduction steps. Review the exported diagnostic package before sharing it because it may contain app lists and logs.
